    <p>Iâ€™m currently a senior at Eastern Washington University majoring in Technical Communication with 2 minors: VCD and Communications. During the summer I am a Babysitter of 4 wonderful kids, as well as a combine driver for the family farm during harvest. With my spare time I enjoy playing guitar, quilting, and photography. I won an XBOX in a coloring contest when I was 6.</p>
